# Demo Script — Grit & Grain (2–3 Minutes)

> **Presenter note:** The demo account is pre-loaded with 12 months of synthetic diary data for "Dry Creek Ranch." All AI responses shown are grounded in that seed data.

---

## Opening (0:00 – 0:20)

> *"Every rancher I've talked to has the same problem: decades of knowledge stored entirely up here [point to head]. What happened to the north pasture in that dry year? When did they last cut hay on the south field? The answer is usually 'I think it was… maybe three years ago?' — and that uncertainty costs money."*

> *"Grit & Grain changes that. It's a voice-first field journal that turns your daily observations into a searchable, AI-powered history of your ranch."*

---

## Act 1 — Recording a Voice Note (0:20 – 0:55)

**Action:** Navigate to the Dashboard. Tap the microphone button.

> *"It starts with the most natural thing in the world — talking. I'm going to record a quick note the way a rancher actually would, right after checking on the animals."*

**Speak into the mic:**
> *"February 28th, moved the Angus herd off the south pasture. Grass is looking thin but the water trough is full after last week's rain — guessing about an inch and a half. Planning to rest south for at least 30 days."*

**Action:** Tap **Stop**. Watch the transcript appear. The entry is automatically tagged to "South Pasture" and today's date.

> *"The note is transcribed, tagged to the right pasture, and saved — no form-filling, no typing. That's the whole input experience."*

---

## Act 2 — Farm Memory Chat (0:55 – 1:50)

**Action:** Navigate to **Farm Memory**. Type (or speak) the question:

> *"When did we last rest the south pasture, and what was the rainfall that month?"*

**Wait for response (≈ 2 seconds).** The AI returns an answer with inline citations.

**Expected response (example):**

> *"The South Pasture was last rested in August 2025 for 28 days following the July rotation move [Entry #142, 2025-07-31]. Recorded rainfall for August 2025 was approximately 0.8 inches across three events [Entry #147, 2025-08-12; Entry #151, 2025-08-22]."*

> *"That's the key thing: every answer cites the actual diary entry it came from. No hallucinated numbers — it's grounded in your history."*

**Ask a second question:**

> *"Has the south pasture ever produced a second hay cut in a dry year?"*

**Action:** Scroll through the cited entries that appear.

> *"It searched across 12 months of entries and found every relevant note. This is what 'longitudinal' means — the more you log, the smarter the answers get."*

---

## Act 3 — Weekly Review (1:50 – 2:25)

**Action:** Navigate to **Weekly Review**. Click **Generate This Week's Review**.

> *"Every week, Grit & Grain synthesises everything you logged into a structured summary — rainfall totals, rotation moves, hay activity, herd health. No more trying to remember what happened Monday when you're doing your Saturday planning."*

**Highlight the "Trends to Watch" section.**

> *"This section flags things worth monitoring next week — things the AI noticed across your entries that you might not have consciously connected."*

---

## Closing (2:25 – 2:45)

> *"Every voice note you record today becomes historical context for a question you haven't thought to ask yet. Three years from now you'll be able to ask 'what did we do the last time we had a dry February?' — and you'll get a real answer, with receipts."*

> *"Grit & Grain: stop relying on memory, start relying on history."*

## Q&A Prompts (if time allows)

- *"What happens to my voice recordings?"* → Transcribed and discarded; only text is stored.
- *"Does it work offline?"* → Not in MVP; offline sync is on the roadmap.
- *"How does the AI know which pasture I'm talking about?"* → NLP entity extraction recognises pasture names from your profile; you can also tap to confirm or correct the auto-tag.
