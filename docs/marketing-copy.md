## Feature Paragraphs

**Voice-First Capture**
Recording a diary entry takes seconds. Tap the microphone, speak naturally about what you saw in the field today, and Grit & Grain handles the rest. Your note is transcribed, automatically tagged to the right pasture or herd, and saved — no forms, no keyboards, no extra steps.

**Farm Memory**
Ask questions about your own ranch the way you'd ask a knowledgeable foreman who was there for every day of it. Farm Memory searches across your entire diary history and surfaces the exact entries that answer your question — with inline citations so you always know where the answer came from. No hallucinated numbers. Just your history, retrieved.

**Weekly Review**
Every week, Grit & Grain synthesizes everything you logged into a structured summary: rainfall totals, rotation moves, hay activity, herd health observations, and trends worth watching heading into the next week. It turns a scattered week of notes into a clear operational picture in seconds.

**Pasture & Herd Management**
Organize your operation the way it works on the ground. Add your pastures and herd groups once, and every diary entry links back to them — giving you a clean timeline for each piece of land and each group of animals over months and years.

## The Problem Paragraph

Ranchers carry decades of hard-won knowledge entirely in their heads. When did the back pasture last rest? What were hay yields the year before the drought? Which rotation held up best through a wet spring? That institutional memory disappears when an operator retires, gets hurt, or simply forgets — and existing farm-management software makes the problem worse by demanding structured data entry at the end of a long day's work. There has never been a tool built for the way ranchers actually operate in the field.

## Product Description (End-User Facing)

**Grit & Grain** is the AI-powered field journal built for ranchers and small-scale farmers who carry their operation's history in their head — and need a better place to keep it.

It works the way you work. After checking on the herd or walking a pasture, you tap a button and talk. Grit & Grain transcribes your voice note, tags it to the right pasture or herd group, and saves it to your farm's permanent record — no typing, no forms, no extra steps. Over time, those daily observations become a longitudinal history of your entire operation.

When you need answers, Farm Memory has them. Ask questions like "When did we last rest the south pasture?" or "Has the north field ever produced a second hay cut in a dry year?" and get responses grounded in your own diary entries, with citations showing exactly which records the answer came from. The AI never guesses — it only tells you what your history says.

Every week, Grit & Grain generates a Weekly Review: a structured summary of everything you logged, including rainfall, rotation moves, hay activity, herd health notes, and trends to watch in the coming week. It turns a scattered week of field observations into a clear, actionable recap in seconds.

The more you log, the more powerful it gets. Three years from now, you'll be able to ask what you did the last time you had a dry February — and you'll get a real answer, with receipts.
